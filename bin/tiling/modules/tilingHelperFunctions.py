    Tiling has so far been implemented such that an optimal divisor is sought that brings the tile resolution as close to a user defined resolution
    A future way of doing it might be to find a "best practice" resolution for the entire pipeline and then add padding functionality to this, to force the tiling into a certain resolution.
    However, tileWriter still does support irregular tiles, it's just not nice to have irregular tiles for downstream functionality.
